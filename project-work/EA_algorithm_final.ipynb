    "The recursive function we've developed is designed to create complex mathematical formulas in a structured format, where each formula is represented as a list: `[operator, first_operand, second_operand]`. This format allows the recursive and hierarchical organization of operations, facilitating the computational evaluation and manipulation of the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of this function include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use of Input Dimensions:** The function uses a list, `used_indices`, to track which input dimensions (e.g., `0,1`, etc.) have been utilized in the formula. This ensures comprehensive coverage of all available input variables (if the depth makes it possible), making the formula relevant to all dimensions of the input data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Restrictions on Trigonometric Functions:** To enhance the mathematical sensibility of the formulas generated, the function includes a specific constraint regarding the nesting of trigonometric functions. Once a trigonometric function (such as `sin`, `cos`, etc.) is used, the function prohibits the inclusion of another trigonometric function within it. This constraint helps in preventing mathematically nonsensical expressions like `sin(cos(tan(x)))`, which, while computationally valid, may not be practically meaningful or may complicate the interpretation and analysis of the formula.\n",
    "3. **Restrictions on operations with constants:** It is not allowed, in the current implementation, to add binary operations between constants. This is another kind of operation that makes the depth of the tree increase without the generation of a real meaningful formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach not only ensures that each formula is robust and contextually appropriate but also maintains clarity and reduces the computational redundancy that might arise from nested trigonometric operations. Such constraints are particularly important in scientific computing and simulations where the accuracy and interpretability of mathematical expressions are critical.\n",

By intentionally allowing less fit individuals a chance to win, fitness holes can help navigate the evolutionary pathway where direct progression is hindered by intermediate steps that reduce overall fitness. This approach ensures that even though the final adaptation is advantageous, the evolutionary path to achieve it can successfully bypass 'fitness holes' that would otherwise deselect the intermediates before the final adaptation is achieved."
